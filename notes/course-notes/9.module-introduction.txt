9.Module Introduction 


So now that we got started and you know what the course is about, the first thing we'll have to do in order to learn about 
tests and write tests is we have to set up a Testing environment. We have to create a project, where we have all the tools 
we need to run tests.


And therefore in this section, I will show you how such an example environment could look like. And I will walk you through 
the required tools and elements we need in such an environment. Of course, I will also show you an example setup.


We'll use a couple of setups, but we'll have a base setup which we'll use for the course and I'll show you that setup,
and you will get all these setups from me. And I will also talk about various alternatives we have at certain points.


Different tools we could use for the same job, and why I'm choosing a certain tool for this course but that what you'll learn 
in this course, will apply in general, no matter which setup you will later use in your projects.
