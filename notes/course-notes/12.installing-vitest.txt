12.Installing Vitest 


Now I did already show you this example
and indeed using vitest in your project,
no matter if it's a frontend project or a node project
as I have it here, using it is as simple as running

npm install --save-dev and then vitest.

You'll run this command, this installs it
into your JavaScript project.
Again, no matter if it's NodeJS or frontend JavaScript.
And then with that installed,
all you need to do is in your package.json file,
you add the test script and you set the value
either to just vitest or vitest --globals.
The --globals flag just makes sure that you can use
special functions like it or expect,
about which you will learn more throughout this course
without any extra imports.
But that is how easy it is to use vitest.
Now, all that being said, I will provide you with projects
where I already set up everything so that we can get started
with testing, because this course is about learning
to test and to write tests, it's not about learning
how to configure different kinds of projects,
hence, I will provide them to you
so that we can focus on the essentials here.
Of course, if you wanna learn more about vitest
or about Jest, check out their official docs,
check out the details you can learn there
to dive really deeply into it.
But with that, that's the kind of setup we're going to use
in this course and that's the kind of setup
we're going to use to learn all about tests.
