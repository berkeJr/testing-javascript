5.A Quick Note About Test-Driven Development (TDD):



Now, before we come to an end for this section here, I also briefly wanna talk about another testing related concept which 
is Test-Driven Development.


Now Test Driven Development is in the end a framework or a philosophy for writing tests, you could say. And the idea behind 
test driven development is that you don't write your application code first and then some tests for that code but that 
instead as a first test before you write any application code, you write failing tests.


Where you in the end define the expected behavior, then you implement the code that should be tested which of course should be 
implemented such that the behavior is met and the test therefore succeeds. And then you can iteratively refactor and go through 
that flow over and over again, and write a new test whenever you want to add a new behavior or a new unit write a failing test 
first, then implement the logic, maybe optimize the logic thereafter and so on.


And that is one interesting way of writing your tests. This course is not about test driven development though. This course is 
about learning the fundamentals of unit testing and how to write tests instead. And once you finished this course, you of 
course  would be ready to also explore the concept of Test-Driven Development if you want to.
